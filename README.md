=======================

It's an assignment for the object orientated programming course.
This game is run in console


Originally implemented in Windows with Visual Studio. This is a linux (MacOS) version. The `kbhit()` function is slightly different from Windows' so users might not be able to skip the combat.


Use the following command to compile and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeruniverse/EvilCastle_Console-Game.git

# compile the game
cd EvilCastle_Console-Game
g++ -o game *.cpp

# play
./game
```

For Windows version (compiled in Visual Studio), checkout the `windows` branch.
